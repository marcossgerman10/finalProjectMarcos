        This platform is designed to guide you through the process of applying for soccer scholarships in the United States.
        To begin your journey, you need to complete the required requisites.

        These requisites are part of a questionnaire. Your answers will determine your eligibility and ensure you meet the initial requirements.
        Once all requisites are successfully completed and verified, you will gain access to the tasks page, where you can start uploading the required documents
        for your eligibility status and university applications.
